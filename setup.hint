ldesc: "SCons is a software construction tool--that is, a superior
alternative to the classic 'Make' build tool that we all know and love.

SCons is implemented as a Python script and set of modules, and SCons
'configuration files' are actually executed as Python scripts. This
gives SCons many powerful capabilities not found in other software build
tools."
